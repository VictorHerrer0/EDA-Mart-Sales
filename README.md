# EDA-Mart-Sales
-- Hello! âœ‹
Welcome to one of my very first Python projects ðŸ¥³

In this project, I'll be leading you through an extensive Exploratory Data analysis with lots of visualizations and plots, understanding a dataset that contains info on Mart Sales analysis.

The project started off as a python practice case and ended up being a good reflection of my current Python knowledge.


# Dataset ðŸ“Ž
I took the Data for this project from ANDRII SAMOSHYN on Kaggle.

The Dataset is publicly open for everyone under this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/big-mart-sales?datasetId=678741

It is a dataset consisting of several variables on Mart sales, location, size of store, etc:

- Item_Identifier: Unique product ID
- Item_Weight: Weight of product
- Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low fat or not
- Item_Visibility: The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product
- Item_Type: The category to which the product belongs
- Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
- Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID
- Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which store was established
- Outlet_Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
- Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city in which the store is located
- Outlet_Type: Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
- Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the particular store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.

# Prework
As for every Data project, there is some prework needed. First of all, I explored the raw data; Plotting lots of basic information to get to know the data.
I think it is crucial to understand what you are working with and to what extend it is useful information.

I plotted and plotted several visuals that allowed me to understand and know everything I had to prior to focusing on the Analysis itself.


# Softwares Used ðŸ’»
I decided to stay classic and run this on a Jupyter Notebook. I consider this to be a wonderful tool for beginners, because of its simplicity and compatibility friendliness.

I have always enjoyed using Jupyter Notebooks, and unless there is a major change and something that I really need that Jupyter does not have, I will keep using it.

The File is a (.ipynb) file that contains all the code, which starts with a broad general analysis and then dives deep into the data.
I hope you enjoy it. ðŸ‘¾
